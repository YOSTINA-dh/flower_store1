# User Experience & User Interface

## PURPOSE

The concept of my Full-Stack Development Milestone is to create an E-commerce shop selling flowers.  

The purpose of this project is to create an e-commerce platform for a small business that is selling flowers by categories ( Different bouquets, funerals, and special items). 

This Project is demostrating not only the understanding of Django & Python and combines it with HTML, CSS & Javascript, but also is demonstrating the understanding of an authentication mechanism, a payment method provider (Stripe) and the use of a relational database.

The app was built using GitHub and deployed to Heroku, with all of static files stored with AWS.
